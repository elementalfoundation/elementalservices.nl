# Elemental Services

Hi there. My name is Dieter Van der Stock.  

I'm a digital engineer. Like the engineer you'd hire to build your factory or office, but with **applications, servers, and security** instead of concrete and steel.

## What I do

I specialise in:

- Custom cybersecurity solutions, in areas like vulnerability management, intrusion detection, and incident response.
- Software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, designing, building and hosting them.
- Operations and security of servers, databases and workstations.

I've also worked on home alarm systems, served as a fallback engineer on retainer, and other projects.  

The specifics of the assignment can be diverse. I enjoy working on **deeply technical projects that serve a clear purpose**, and I appreciate variety.

I prefer working in **Linux and open-source** environments, but that’s not a hard requirement.

## Clients

## How I work

I mostly work **async**, meaning I choose when I work on projects, and that doesn’t necessarily conform to 9–5, Monday to Friday.  

I do insist on **clear, regular, and respectful communication**, both ways. 

## More on how I work 

It's good to **start with a small, well-defined project**, to give us time to build trust and limit risk.

A good first project is to onboard me with the problem you’re trying to solve, your company, your processes, and your business, and let me deliver something small but useful. The deliverables will be both the code and the onboarding documentation.  

If you want to open source what we make, I’ll support that decision. Elemental Services is owned by the [Elemental Foundation](https://elementalfoundation.org), and open source supports our mission directly. But no code will be published unless you explicitly agree to it.

This is all about me. But I look forward to learning how you like to work, too.  

Reach out if I can be of help.
